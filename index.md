Currently working on:

 * [Coalesce](./coalesce/) ~ Coalesce in the spirit of the SQL `COALESCE` function.
 * [Jacket](./jacket/) ~ JSON record parser for JSON as packets.
 * [Rendezvous](./rendezvous/) ~ Allow two or more collaborating services to find each other through an HTTP proxy.
 * [Upgrader](./upgrader/) ~ Upgrade HTTP sockets to raw sockets and do what you want with them. Scandalous! It's true.
